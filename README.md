# simpleweb-java

This is an ultra-simple web server written in java. It returns a welcome message and also print outs the server's IP address and listening TCP port. This is useful for demo purposes and load-balancing testing. It also looks for the environment variable $PORT0 and starts the server in that port if the variable exists. This is useful for deployment with Marathon and DC/OS.

Pull the docker image into docker or marathon. Or download and run the .jar file locally.
